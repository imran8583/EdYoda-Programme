        "Q 1. What are Data Types?\n",
        "Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.\n",

        "Q 2. Name four of the main data types in Python?\n",
        "Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, files, and sets are generally considered the main types of data. Types, None, and Booleans are sometimes also classified this way. The integer, floating-point, complex, fraction and decimal are numerical data types and simple strings and Unicode strings in Python 2 and text strings and byte strings in Python 3 are the types of string data types.\n",

        "An immutable data type is a type of object which cannot be modified after its creation. Numbers, strings, and tuples in Python fall into this category. Although you cannot modify an immutable object in place, you can always create a new one by running an expression.\n"
